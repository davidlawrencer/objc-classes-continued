//properties age and name

//what do we put for a method in the interface?
// the signature for our function
// we want this to print name and age
// In swift, how would i get the values of those properties? string interpolate self.name and self.yearsOld

//although Obj-C makes us use the [message format] for calling methods, with our accessors we can use the dot format for getting/setting them.
