/*Warmup: Create the interface and implementation for a Person class, which has:
    - a "name" property that is an NSString,
    - an "age" property that is an int
    - a "popPitch" instance method that logs out the person's age and name as part of a string
 how would we do that in swift - could be a computed property.
 let person = Person()
 // how do we denote an instance method
 starting line with - defines/sets up an instance method
 starting line with + defines/sets up a class method.
